“Hmm, there’s one more, isn’t there?” As Shalltear looked around, the two
vampires quickly presented a sufficiently large rock. “Oomph.” As a bell chimed

moved at a frightening speed. A moment later, Shalltear happily announced her
accomplishment. “Hmm. This time… We can call that… Two strikes.” Another round
of applause.
